  This is a complex paragraph that demonstrates nested markdown formatting. For
  example,<em
    >here is some italic text that includes<strong>bold content</strong
    >inside</em
  >and then some more text. Also, consider<strong
    >this bold section which contains<em>italic nested inside bold</em>for
    further emphasis</strong
  >. Finally, mix things up with a deeper nest:<em
    >outer italics<strong
      >bold inside<em>even deeper italics</em>and back to bold</strong
    >end of outer</em
  >.
