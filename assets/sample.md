## Introduction

This is a sample Markdown file to test the Markdown to HTML converter. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to format **plaintext** documents.

## Features

- Headers (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.)
- Bold and _italic_ text
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Inline `code` and code blocks
- Links and images

## Code Example

Here is a simple Rust function:

```rust
fn hello() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
